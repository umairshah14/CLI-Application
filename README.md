# README Generator

## Description
I created this repository to hold my submission for the week 11 challenge which was to create a README generator, to run the README generator you simply run the following command: node index.js once youve opened the repository in your terminal. Once its run, it will ask a series of questions in your terminal, the answers recieved will then be displayed in a new README file that appears in the "dist" folder

This task helped me really grasp how to work with node JS and how to import/ require libraries for me to work with. I also learnt a lot about NPM commands.

## Usage

Below is a screenshot of what the terminal should look like once the program is run and answers are given to the questions asked
